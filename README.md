# SolFlow: Solana Transaction Flow Visualization & Analysis Platform

## Overview

SolFlow is a comprehensive blockchain analytics platform designed to transform complex Solana transaction data into intuitive, user-friendly visualizations and insights. The platform empowers users to visualize transaction flows between wallets, track funding sources, identify suspicious patterns, and collaborate in real-time with team members.

In an era where blockchain transactions continue to grow in complexity and volume, SolFlow addresses the critical need for transparent, accessible, and collaborative blockchain analysis tools. Whether you're a financial investigator, compliance professional, researcher, or crypto enthusiast, SolFlow provides powerful visualization capabilities to understand and analyze on-chain activities.

## Key Features

### Interactive Transaction Flow Visualization

SolFlow's core functionality centers around its interactive flow visualization engine, which displays transaction relationships between wallets on the Solana blockchain. The visualization:

- Presents wallets as nodes and transactions as directional edges
- Supports multiple layout algorithms (force-directed, circular, hierarchical)
- Provides intuitive zoom and pan capabilities for exploring complex networks
- Allows filtering by transaction type, date ranges, and amounts
- Highlights critical transaction paths automatically
- Enables direct interaction with nodes to explore wallet histories
- Supports double-clicking on wallets to view them in Solscan

### Wallet Analysis & Tracking

The platform provides comprehensive wallet analysis features:

- Tracking of funding sources through transaction history
- Historical transaction timelines with volume analysis
- Detection of wallet activity patterns and anomalies
- Automatic labeling of known entities (exchanges, protocols, etc.)
- Transaction clustering to identify related transaction groups
- Risk scoring based on transaction patterns and connections

### Collaborative Analysis Environment

SolFlow introduces collaborative blockchain analysis with:

- Real-time team collaboration on visualizations
- Team management with customizable roles and permissions
- Shared visualization workspaces for team members
- Annotation capabilities for marking specific wallets or transactions
- Comment threads for discussing findings

## User Guide

### Navigation

The SolFlow interface is organized into several key sections:

1. **Transaction Flow Visualization**: The main visualization area showing wallet nodes and transaction edges
2. **Filter Sidebar**: Controls for filtering the visualization by date, amount, and transaction type
3. **Transaction Timeline**: Chronological representation of transaction activity
4. **Wallet Summary**: Overview of wallet activity, balance, and risk metrics
5. **Entity Clustering**: Grouping of related wallets into logical entities

### Basic Usage

#### Searching for Wallets

1. Enter a Solana wallet address in the search box
2. The platform will fetch transaction data and display the visualization
3. Connected wallets will appear as nodes with transactions represented as directional edges

#### Interacting with the Visualization

- **Click on a node**: View wallet details and filter the visualization to show only interactions with that wallet
- **Double-click on a node**: Open the wallet in Solscan for deeper analysis
- **Click on an edge**: View transaction details
- **Double-click on an edge**: Open the transaction in Solscan
- **Zoom/Pan**: Use the controls or mouse/touchpad to navigate the visualization
- **Change Layout**: Select different visualization layouts using the dropdown

#### Filtering Data

The filter sidebar allows you to:
- Set date ranges for transactions
- Filter by transaction amount (min/max)
- Select specific transaction types (transfers, swaps, NFTs, etc.)
- Include or exclude specific programs

#### Saving and Sharing

- Click the "Save & Share" button to save your current visualization
- Use the sharing options to invite team members or generate a link
