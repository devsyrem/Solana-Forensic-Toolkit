4. Click "Add Annotation"

Users can also reply to annotations, creating threaded discussions about specific findings.

## Codebase Structure

The SolFlow codebase follows a client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

```

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a component-based architecture using React. It's organized into:

1. **Presentation Components**: UI components that render data and handle user interactions
2. **Container Components**: Connect presentation components to data sources and services
3. **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate and share stateful logic between components
4. **Services**: Handle API communication and data transformation

Key design patterns used:
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separation of data and presentation concerns
- **Custom Hook Pattern**: Reusable stateful logic
- **Context API**: Global state management for authentication and theme
- **Render Props**: Component composition for complex UI elements

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a route-controller-service architecture:

1. **Routes**: Define API endpoints and handle HTTP requests
2. **Services**: Contain business logic and data manipulation
3. **Storage Interface**: Abstracts database operations
4. **Database Layer**: Handles data persistence

Key design patterns used:
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction for data access
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies through constructors
- **Middleware Pattern**: Request processing pipeline
- **Adapter Pattern**: Integration with external systems (Solana RPC)

## WebSocket Protocol

The WebSocket implementation uses a simple message protocol:

```typescript
interface WebSocketMessage {
  type: string;
  [key: string]: any;
}

// Example message types
interface JoinVisualizationMessage extends WebSocketMessage {
  type: 'join-visualization';
  visualizationId: number;
  userId: number;
  username: string;
}

interface CursorUpdateMessage extends WebSocketMessage {
  type: 'cursor-update';
  visualizationId: number;
  userId: number;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
}

interface NewAnnotationMessage extends WebSocketMessage {
  type: 'new-annotation';
  visualizationId: number;
  annotationId: number;
  userId: number;
  username: string;
}
```

These messages are serialized as JSON for transmission over the WebSocket connection.

## Blockchain Integration

The application integrates with the Solana blockchain through:

1. **Connection Setup**:
   ```typescript
   import { Connection } from '@solana/web3.js';
   
   export function getSolanaConnection(): Connection {
     const endpoint = process.env.SOLANA_RPC_URL || "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com";
     return new Connection(endpoint);
   }
   ```

2. **Transaction Fetching**:
   ```typescript
   async function fetchTransactionsForWallet(address: string): Promise<Transaction[]> {
     const connection = getSolanaConnection();
     const publicKey = new PublicKey(address);
     
     // Fetch signatures
     const signatures = await connection.getSignaturesForAddress(
       publicKey,
       { limit: 100 }
     );
     
     // Fetch transaction details
     const transactionDetails = await connection.getParsedTransactions(
       signatures.map(sig => sig.signature)
     );
     
     // Transform and store transactions
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Parse raw transaction data
   - Extract sender, receiver, amounts
   - Identify transaction types
   - Calculate relationships between wallets

### Solana Transaction Processing

The application processes Solana transactions in several steps:

1. **Fetch Transaction Signatures**: Get recent transaction signatures for a wallet
2. **Fetch Transaction Details**: Get parsed transaction data for each signature
3. **Extract Relevant Information**:
   - Sender and receiver addresses
   - Transaction amount and token type
   - Program ID to determine transaction type
   - Timestamp and block information

4. **Process Instruction Data**: Different instructions require specific parsing:
   - System Program transfers
   - Token Program transfers
   - Swap operations
   - NFT transactions
   - DeFi interactions

5. **Build Transaction Graph**:
   - Create nodes for wallets
   - Create edges for transactions
   - Calculate edge weights based on amounts
   - Apply layout algorithms

1. **Data Pagination**: Limit transaction fetching to manageable chunks
2. **Lazy Loading**: Defer loading of visualization data until needed
3. **Memoization**: Cache expensive computations using useMemo and useCallback
4. **Virtualization**: Render only visible elements in large lists
5. **Code Splitting**: Dynamically import components when needed
6. **Progressive Rendering**: Show core UI quickly and load details progressively

## Security Considerations

SolFlow implements several security measures:

1. **Authentication**: Secure login with session management
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for teams and visualizations
3. **Data Validation**: Input validation using Zod schemas
4. **HTTPS**: Encrypted communication for all data transfers
5. **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration using environment variables

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Application Fails to Start

If the application fails to start, check:

1. Database connection: Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible
2. Port conflicts: Make sure port 5000 is not in use by another application
3. Environment variables: Verify all required environment variables are set correctly

### Slow Transaction Loading

If transaction data loads slowly:

1. Check your Solana RPC endpoint performance
2. Consider using a dedicated RPC service
3. Apply more specific filters to reduce the amount of data fetched

### Authentication Issues

If you encounter login problems:

1. Clear your browser cookies
2. Check that the database tables for users and sessions are properly created
3. Verify that the `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable is set

### Missing Transaction Data

If transaction data appears incomplete:

1. Public RPC endpoints may have rate limits or data retention policies
2. Some specialized transactions might not be parsed correctly
3. Try using a dedicated RPC endpoint with complete historical data

### Real-time Updates Not Working

If you're not seeing real-time updates:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the page to reconnect the WebSocket
3. Verify that you have the appropriate permissions
4. Check if other real-time features (like presence indicators) are working

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
   SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://your-solana-rpc-endpoint
   ```
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Development Practices

1. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for all code
2. **Code Formatting**: Follow consistent formatting with Prettier
3. **Linting**: Enforce code quality with ESLint
4. **Commit Conventions**: Use conventional commits
5. **Pull Request Process**: Code reviews for all changes

## Future Roadmap

The SolFlow project continues to evolve with planned enhancements:

1. **Multi-chain Support**: Extending visualization capabilities to other blockchains
2. **Advanced Pattern Detection**: Machine learning integration for anomaly detection
3. **Customizable Dashboards**: User-configurable analytics dashboards
4. **Reporting Engine**: Export capabilities for compliance and investigation reports
5. **API Access**: Programmatic access to analysis capabilities
6. **Mobile Support**: Enhanced mobile experience for on-the-go analysis
